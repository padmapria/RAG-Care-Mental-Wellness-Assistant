0,Do I have too many issues for counseling,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac. I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling",https://counselchat.com/questions/do-i-have-too-many-issues-for-counseling,depression,"It is very common for people to have multiple issues that they want to (and need to) address in counseling. I have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration, there is often an underlying fear that they ""can't be helped"" or that they will ""be too much for their therapist."" I don't know if any of this rings true for you. But, most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not, people have numerous significant stressors in their lives. Let's face it, life can be complicated! Therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session. Most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress. You can never have too many issues to address in counseling. All of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling",Jennifer MolinariHypnotherapist & Licensed Counselor

A competent therapist will assist you in identifying the root causes of your problems and treat those first. If the underlying issues are addressed, your various symptoms should improve. For example, a history of sexual trauma can cause sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, and low self-worth. I would start by addressing the underlying trauma using EMDR Therapy. EMDR allows the client to process unresolved trauma and to address negative core beliefs that develop in response to the trauma. By addressing these negative beliefs about ourselves, we can improve our self-esteem and feelings of self-worth","Jason Lynch, MS, LMHC, LCAC, ADSIndividual & Couples Therapy"
1,My apartment manager won't let me keep an emotional support dog,"I have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor.

What do you suggest I do",https://counselchat.com/questions/my-apartment-manager-won-t-let-me-keep-an-emotional-support-dog,depression,"Your apartment manager is legally required under federal law to allow the ESA to live with you if you have provided documentation from a licensed therapist. It does not matter if they have a no-pet policy if you have met these qualifications.You do not need a trained service animal nor do you need a disability for an emotional support animal. The Fair Housing Act (which has federal jurisdiction) allows you to own an ESA if you have met the right criteria, and it sounds like you do. Perhaps your apartment manager needs a letter from a therapist instead of a doctor? Here's the site for more information on this and steps to take: https://esadoctors.com/landlord-emotional-support-animal/Maybe your doctor is credible and can help you continue to fight for yourself. In the above website, it mentions that if you provide the required documentation and your apartment manager continues to deny you, you can file a complaint with HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).I am repeating some of that article content here, but I believe many people in this situation feel pressured to share personal information about their symptoms and circumstances, beyond what is legally required for an ESA.

To know these areas more deeply would define the type of people with whom you identify, have a common interest and with whom you'd like to socialize.The more you realize who you are, the easier time you'll have to find like-minded others and feel securely at home with them and yourself.Again, if you have a medical disability or condition which prevents employment or easily socializing with other people, then this advice would need to be modified for your specific strengths","Sherry Katz, LCSWCouples and Family Therapist, LCSW"
4,How can I help my girlfriend,My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay,https://counselchat.com/questions/how-can-i-help-my-girlfriend,depression,"You're probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". A lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same","Kristi King-Morgan, LMSWSocial Worker, Psychotherapist"

Emotionally, it's an exhausting condition and can take a lot of energy from the body. Depression is a common consequence of PTSD since many people experience functional repercussions (impacts in work, social, and familial settings). It's not fun to feel constantly terrified. To search for a therapist trained in what you are dealing with, it could be helpful to specifically search for folks who specialize in treating PTSD. You can do that through Google searches, or you can also head over to Psychology Today and Therapy Den. Both sites are therapist directories where you can narrow down the type of therapist you are looking for, as well as other factors like insurance they accept and location.You are on the right track coming here so keep up the search","Kaileen McMickle, MS, LPCLicensed Professional Counselor"

7,How do I know if I have depression,"I had a very troubled up bringing and I'm currently dealing with alot right now. I know some people may not think so, but to me its a lot. I feel overwhelmed. Could this be depression? I use to be in therapy as a child. Alll throughout elementry, middle, and high school I had counseling 2-3 times a week. I haven't be in counseling lately though",https://counselchat.com/questions/how-do-i-know-if-i-have-depression-3,depression,"Thanks for reaching out with this important question!To start, I'll say the diagnosis for depression can differ depending on what the context of those markers are. For example, depression is diagnosed differently if there's a bipolar element or if someone is withdrawing from drugs or alcohol. It doesn't sound like that's what you're experiencing, but those are just two examples of many. How that's diagnosed is a process that a therapist is best equipped to do in person with a thorough assessment. Sometimes we find that depression is subclinical, meaning it doesn't reach the typical level of ""disorder"" (that doesn't mean it's less important or worthy of care). Most of the time, diagnosis doesn't make a huge difference in treatment, but there are some disorders that need pretty specific modalities and components--for example, people with Bipolar I often need medication to help stabilize symptoms.I'd also say that, more importantly, you know yourself best. You are clearly trying to make sense of some things you are feeling and maybe how they are connected to some things you've been through. I can also see you are motivated to feel better! No matter what others think, your perceptions and experiences are most important. You get to decide whether or not your circumstances are a lot for you. Not everyone is built the same and that is certainly impacted by trauma and significant stressors in the developmental years. It's also not your fault that things are hard. You didn't ask for, nor did you create, your life experiences.Overall, if you know some of your healing may come from naming what you feel you can absolutely continue to seek out solid information (and maybe that will be with a counselor if that's what you desire). Kudos to you for asking this question here, too. You are dedicated to yourself whether you see it that way or not","Kaileen McMickle, MS, LPCLicensed Professional Counselor"

How can I fight this,https://counselchat.com/questions/how-can-i-best-fight-the-winter-blues,depression,"Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons, especially fall to winter. Everyone suffers with some form of this (lessened activity levels, increased isolation, etc.) while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression. If you have noticed that this happens frequently, there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward:1. Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood. It's important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools. 2. Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities. It's easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months, when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day, but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly. Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights, complete with hot chocolate and a fire?3. You may want to consider the purchase of a S.A.D. Light. These are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin D in our bodies, as well as the release of growth hormone (which releases when we wake up). There are mixed reviews of these products, however, and they can be expensive",Cimberly R. NeskerRegistered Psychotherapist (3579)

How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone",https://counselchat.com/questions/can-i-change-my-feeling-of-being-worthless-to-everyone,depression,"Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it"" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC","Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCCMental Health in a Primary Care Setting"

I am sorry that you have been feeling like you are not worth knowing or that you do not do anything right. Those are hard feelings to have! Added to the challenge is the current state of things related to COVID-19. Have you noticed an increase in these feelings during the stay at home mandates? If you felt this same way before all of the changes that have occurred over the past few months, how is it different (if at all) when you were able to go to classes and do things with friends? One way that helps me to understand what depression feels like is to imagine that you are wearing dark sunglasses all of the time; because they are always on they make everything that you look at appear darker. When sadness or a low mood is the norm and you cannot find things to get excited about or look forward to that is a good indication that it is time to seek professional help. There are many things that you can do to help lift your mood (exercise, eat healthy foods and drink, get adequate sleep, share your feelings with someone you can trust, decrease social media exposure, etc.), it is important to explore all of the options that are available to you. Seeking out counseling or talking to a doctor that knows you and your medical history well is a first step towards changing the feelings you described. If it is determined that you are experiencing depression there are options that will help you feel better. I hope this helps to give you hope that what you are feeling can improve. Once your mood lifts you will have the energy you need to combat the thoughts that say you are not worth knowing or that you cannot do anything right.

I recommend that you find a trustworthy adult to talk to. This may be a teacher, a coach, a school counselor, a minister, a family member, or a friend's family member.

I am trying to seek help",https://counselchat.com/questions/if-i-am-trying-to-stop-self-harming-and-i-seek-help-will-i-need-to-be-put-in-an-inpatient-setting,depression,"Glad you are reaching out here!There are two types of self-harm: suicidal and non-suicidal. A lot of people I see and have seen engage in self-harm just to manage emotional dysregulation, but not to end their lives. Self-injury actually does a great job at helping us to manage really intense emotional states--even from a chemical level in the body. When you self-harm, it's triggers your body's endorphin production, which is a chemical that makes us feel good. I'm not saying you should do it, but I understand why you would choose that option because it is pretty powerful.To answer your question, I've never heard of anyone being admitted into inpatient for trying to stop non-suicidal self-injuring. Even some people I've worked with that are suicidal and self-harming have remained outpatient given we have an extensive safety plan, including how to reach out for help and coping skill development. Unless you are at high risk of suicide, you would most likely be outpatient. I also work from a harm reduction model, meaning that if you have to self-harm it might as well be as safe as possible. When people are trying to stop, sometimes the pressure gets in the way and they relapse (very normal and actually expected). So we prepare for that by discussing measures to take to make sure the method you use is very safe. Things here include making sure anything piercing the skin is properly disinfected, areas on the body to avoid cutting, and self-harm alternatives that still cause pain but are much safer. For example, some people hold ice in the palm of their hands, or snap rubber bands on their wrists. There are many websites that have safer alternatives as well if you just do a quick google search. Have patience with yourself here, too. You've found a way to manage a whole lot of emotions--and it's worked for you--you did that by yourself! You also want better for yourself and have made the first steps for change and that's really spectacular. It'll be similar to quitting any habit, so stick in there. And if you find a counselor that fits for you, even better! I wish you so much luck","Kaileen McMickle, MS, LPCLicensed Professional Counselor"

However, many clients who struggle with self-harm can find help in outpatient settings - particularly those which offer a treatment called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). Looking for a DBT professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful, but a skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions. Without knowing your location, I also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline. The volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area. Calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to self-harming when you're feeling overwhelmed","Nicole StoneAnxiety, relationship crisis, and the separation/divorce experience."

If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process.

And Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can haunt us for a long time if we do not learn to process the memories that cause those symptoms. If you have been victim of a traumatic event that you are not prepared to share with your parents, it’s important that you seek help with a counselor, therapist or psychologist. Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a great technique to cope with physical symptoms, you could also use Narrative therapy, Creative Therapy or Journaling as a way to express memories and process them with your therapist. A psychiatrist can also prescribe medication to manage the symptoms, but is very important that you address the trauma so you can heal and go back to live your life. Many organizations like the United Way (2-1-1 in many states) offer resources and referrals to put you in touch with mental health providers, you could also talk to your school counselor, doctor or church to find referral that could help.

Think about what that takes--a lot of patience, great emotional awareness, flexibility to adjust to needs and change plans, etc. What that also means is that you probably had to focus so heavily on him that you weren't able to give any of that attention to yourself. The great part is that it doesn't look a whole lot different when you give that to you vs someone else. Self-love and self-care is a really important piece of managing anxiety (and depression), as you learned with your ex.The other thing I noticed is that it sounds like you maybe tend to people-please. This is common with people that are helpers--they are almost a package deal. People-pleasing is really about abandonment. It's derived from a fear that if you aren't exactly what people need, they may have negative feelings toward you and ultimately abandon or reject you. May also stem from a need for peace if you grew up in a chaotic home (common with kiddos from domestic violence backgrounds), though that usually has some type of connection to abandonment as well.As far as anxiety management goes, there's so much you can do. It's hard to say what will work specifically for you, but first thing that might help is to understand your triggers. What gives you anxiety? Is it general and seems to come out of nowhere? Or does it buildup and get worse at a certain time of day? I find that many people who have unresolved grief and depression tend to cycle through those symptoms and anxiety because there's so much stress and pressure involved in the cluster of issues that those circumstances tend to bring. Sorting those things out can be tough---if you need help from a friend or counselor, it's never too late to reach out. It doesn't matter if it happened last week or 10 years ago. If it matters to you, it's relevant.I hope some of this helps and you are able to find someone in your life to lean on. You aren't meant to be alone","Kaileen McMickle, MS, LPCLicensed Professional Counselor"
29,How can I manage my anxiety,I have twin toddlers. I experienced a death of loved one prior to giving birth. I had a horrible break up with the father. People told him he was using me for money. My ex-boyfriend had extreme meltdowns every day for three years. I’m always alone with no friends,https://counselchat.com/questions/how-can-i-manage-my-anxiety-2,depression,"First, let me say that you are a survivor and a warrior.

This is the challenge, especially when we have so many things to manage each day. There are several methods and practices that help manage and even reduce symptoms of anxiety. It will depend on what works best for you. Talk with friends, a counselor, or a loved one who can offer you support and feedback as you navigate this process of learning what works for you. When all else fails; make sure you are in a safe place, pause for a deep, cleansing breath in, a long exhale out, and ask yourself, ""What do I want in this moment?""

You have no idea what is going to happen in the next second, so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story. Remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up. The false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams. Next, do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator? If not, find out. Then, set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps. As you accomplish each step, see your progress. Notice that you are moving closer to your goal. Every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career. In fact, write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror. When you start to feel discouraged, remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if you'll make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out.

If you are really struggling, sometimes meds can help to calm the brain a bit.

37,How can I handle my alcoholic son,"I have an alcoholic son who is draining me financially. I want to get him help, but he doesn't want help. It's making me anxious and depressed",https://counselchat.com/questions/how-can-i-handle-my-alcoholic-son,depression,"What a heavy situation to be in. It must be really hard to feel like you aren't able to help your son and the help you do try to give isn't truly helping him or you. There's some things in this situation that are out of your control--what your son does, if he takes help or doesn't, and the feelings that come up for you about that. I can only imagine how draining it would be as a parent to be unable to change something so important. It makes sense you'd be feeling anxious and depressed.Let's switch for a minute to the things you have total control over--what are those things in this situation? Maybe that's how you express your love for your son. Or maybe it's how you choose to support him (even if it feels like it's a betrayal to him). Pay attention as well to the amount of worry you experience--how much of that helps you plan vs how much of that is excess? Knowing what worry isn't necessary can help to put you in control of how you spend some of your time. You can replace this time with some self-care instead, giving back to yourself.Finding support groups or people that have similar situations can be very helpful. I'd say they are almost necessary. Knowing other people get what you are going through and understand the emotional toll can be somewhat healing. They may also know other resources or ideas you can try that are available to people in your situation.Something else to consider is grief work. Letting go of some or all of the situation with your son (if that's what it comes down to) is a giant loss. You probably already went through losing who your son was before the addiction, so it could be worth exploring the impact that had and has on you","Kaileen McMickle, MS, LPCLicensed Professional Counselor"

Self-diagnosing is not typically recommended since there could be a misinterpretation of the criteria even if you do seem to ""fit the mold"". How you interpret how you feel or how you behave can be distorted, no matter who you are. I actually did this to myself when I was in graduate school and it turned out to be wrong!With that being said, I believe people are the experts on their lives and know best what is happening for them. What is telling you that you have these diagnoses? What does it mean about you if you do? I don't give a ton of weight to diagnoses in the sense of treatment because a lot of diagnoses share the same underlying themes and origins. Both Borderline Personality Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder can be a result of childhood trauma, so treating one may not look that different from treating the other one---and the most important factor will always be the relationship you have with your therapist otherwise treatment won't work.I do give a lot of weight to diagnoses in terms of emotional relief. It can be really stressful to feel like there's something ""wrong"" with you and not be able to give it a category. It can reduce stigma as well to know that what's happening to you is normal for what you've been through, and that others are going through it, too. And it definitely helps to know that there are ways to help and people that know how to help you.Either way, kudos to you for noticing something in your life that you want to change!

How do I tell them this and ask for therapy,https://counselchat.com/questions/how-do-i-tell-my-parents-that-i-think-i-have-some-mental-problems,depression,"Talking with parents can be very challenging, even if they are loving and understanding. Have you ever discussed these issues in the past? If so, how did they respond? It'd make sense if you were avoiding a discussion if they have responded negatively to you, or even neutrally. We rely on our parents for action when we are in need and it can feel so disappointing when they don't meet our needs. If this is the case for you, you could still reach out to them if you feel safe to. That might mean being very candid about what you need from them or what you are seeking for yourself. Sounds like you already know you are struggling and you want to get some help which is awesome.Do you worry they won't believe you? Or that they'll be disappointed in you for self-harming? If you are struggling with these worries, it may be worth talking to another trusted adult about how to bring the issues up to your parents. Maybe that adult could be part of the conversation if appropriate or available? Also, do you have any siblings that are old enough to be part of the conversation? Or maybe be a shoulder to lean on? No matter what happens, social support is really important so you don't have to go through it all alone.Is it possible that your parents or even one of your parents will be proud of you for speaking up for yourself and trying to get help? Sometimes depression and anxiety immobilizes us because we fear the worst, when in reality there are many more possibilities. One of the things I have my teen clients work on if they want to communicate something to a caregiver is have them come up with a bullet-point list of the things they need them to know. So maybe your list would include symptoms you've been struggling with, how you want to change, and what you need from them to help you change. If you do this and it doesn't turn out well, remember that it's on them and not you. Sometimes parents are doing the best they can, and sometimes it's not good enough. That never means you aren't worth helping. It could be helpful to make a backup plan for how you will try to reach out to someone if they don't respond well.You also don't specify your age, or if you are even a teen. I'm assuming you are, but if not, you may be able to get help without their consent or help. If you are closer to age 18, you may not have long to wait.

It's hard to watch someone you care about feel depressed and I'm guessing it brings you down, too. Change is tricky. Most people need to hit a ""rock bottom"" before they can transform their lives. Rock bottom is a moving target though--meaning one person's rock bottom could look completely different than someone else's. For some people that's a trip to the hospital, for others it's failing an exam. It's about what brings up enough discomfort (with awareness of why) with the current way of living that not changing would be more painful.Depression is so hard, but it can also be weirdly comforting. It sucks to feel sad, but at least you know what to expect. He knows that he's going to get high, zone out into his phone, and his anger is probably pretty predictable. On the other hand, change is uncertain. Is he open to seeing a therapist? Or open to trying anything new with you? If not, that's not your fault nor is it your responsibility. You obviously care, but that doesn't mean it's on you if he doesn't follow through. It seems like maybe he feels some comfort in the daily structure that you described, but even getting out for a walk could help his mindset a bit. Overall, it's not a guarantee that you can help him, though it is really incredible that you have so much empathy for him.

41,is it normal not to feel empathy,"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself",https://counselchat.com/questions/is-it-normal-not-to-feel-empathy,depression,"Thank you for posting. I'm interested to hear some more information; such as, if you live by yourself or family, if you go to school/employed/unemployed, and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself. Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion. There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion. When we overgeneralize, we use words like ""always"" or ""never"" and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you. Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I'm overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn't feeling anxious? What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about? When was the last time I felt empathy? What was different when I was able to feel empathy?

Not sleeping can really make changes in your emotions seem much larger.Can you find anything in your life that is the same as it was before the breakup? This may be a starting point for you. I wonder if you could think of and moment or two each day when you feel emotionally at peace while you are awake. Also consider looking at things that you can control, such as when you choose to wear, eat, and who you talk to about your deepest feelings.You mentioned that you have friends and family. I wonder if any of them are supportive to you.Please reach out and talk to someone about the details.

43,How do I find out the cause of my depression and anxiety,"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of",https://counselchat.com/questions/how-do-i-find-out-the-cause-of-my-depression-and-anxiety,depression,"The first thing I usually recommend to clients that are coming in for these issues in addition to stress management is visiting their doctor. We really don't know if it's something psychological that's influencing your symptoms, or if there's other issues happening within the body. Pancreas or thyroid issues can perpetuate anxiety and depression symptoms pretty intensely--these are things your doctor knows more about and can help test for (and maybe rule out).As you probably already know, lack of sleep is a giant contributor to an increase in symptoms. We don't know too much about sleep in the research, but we do know it's necessary to function and function well. Some suggestions here from the research we do have: creating a calming routine at night can help with your body's relationship to sleep. This can be your normal nightly hygiene paired with some relaxing videos or soundscapes (there are apps for this--Calm, Headspace, PanicShield). Practicing these for a few weeks can help your brain pair your routine with sleeping. Another suggestion directly from the research is not to take naps. Yes, your brain needs sleep, but napping messes with our circadian rhythm and our quality/quantity of nightly sleep. When we sleep, we go through sleep stages--but when we nap, those stages aren't completed like they would be during a full night of sleep where we go through those stages multiple times. Both deep sleep and REM sleep (typically when we dream) seems to be especially important for feeling rested. Napping usually only offers us a small dose of that, whereas a full night can offer as many more completed cycles including both these stages. If you are waking into a panic attack, this site may give you some info on what that means: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/expert-answers/panic-attacks/faq-20057984.

As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down. It is normal to feel down once in a while. From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind. Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal. They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment. They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good","Sherry Katz, LCSWCouples and Family Therapist, LCSW"

Sounds like you have been trying super hard!It's common for people to go through a few therapists before they find a fit. I agree with the prior post that relationship is the most important factor in counseling, otherwise techniques don't really work. It can be the case that you are connecting with your counselor but not able to implement what you are learning for whatever reason. That's pretty typical in depression when lethargy is high and motivation is low. Have you discussed your medication with your prescribing provider? It seems like you have advocated for yourself in the past and have put some effort into trying new things. That's actually really tough to do, depression or not! When I have clients that seem to make no progress despite many sessions and different medications, I recommend trying a service called GeneSight. Here's the link: https://genesight.com/.This service allows you find medications that fit best with your genetic makeup. I don't have any affiliation to this service, but I've seen some success for people that have followed through since it is very personalized. I believe some insurance companies cover the full cost and it's easy to use.Let me also point out that your motivation is spectacular.

45,How can I help my husband after a suicide attempt,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again",https://counselchat.com/questions/how-can-i-help-my-husband-after-a-suicide-attempt,depression,"Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very serious time. I don't mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization, to get follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter. So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always a good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. I do hope things work out alright. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC","Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCCMental Health in a Primary Care Setting"

He was taken care of by others and now is again left alone with his own internal, and rather horrific inner struggle.In my work with CCT, or Contextual Conceptual Therapy, (see www.suicidetherapy.com) I have learned how trapped suicidal people are in their own isolation, also called a ""mysterious isolation,"" a form of self protection which cuts the off from their Self, or spirit. And unless they address this message from their soul, accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information, that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty, their Self, and their ability to receive love from themselves and others. Their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer. They take this literally and try to end their life, when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is they need to begin to live the life they came here to live",Catherine HobsonFeelings are clues to growth and meaning

It could be that there are things that are affecting how upset you are, but because so many other things are going on, you may not notice.Another idea to try is to keep a list for a month of one good thing that happened each day. This way, when you're having a rough day, you have a list to think of and take a look at.Are you eating and sleeping in ways that are typical for you (typically at least two meals per day and roughly 8 hours of sleep that night (may be different depending on your age)? These two ideas are closely related to changes in your mood.From where do you have support? Friends or family?Can you take 5 or 10 minutes per day to do something that you enjoy?If you think back to the last time that you felt ""content,"" what was contributing to that?Another possibility is to try to be mindful of things that you do every day. For example, rather than eating a turkey sandwich as fast as possible on your lunch break, consider actually tasting it and enjoying it. Also consider giving yourself praise for doing something well. For example, when you finish your paperwork, take a moment to notice that and maybe reward yourself by checking your e-mail, reading five pages of a book, or something else that can be done quickly before you get back to your next task","Lauren Ostrowski, MA, LPC, NCC, BC-TMH, CCTP, CCHI tailor my therapeutic approach to each client's strengths and goals"

According to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this. When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior. Another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences. Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, in this case sadness or depression, and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior.

This is one of the most common things that I personally have seen in the population of individuals who suffer from depression.

It is inspiring that you have noticed this in yourself because many clients are not aware that this is a pattern for them, or are not yet willing to face that depression has become a pattern they cling to. Depression, if dealt with for extended periods of time, can become a way of life, an identity of sorts, that is very difficult to part from. While you desperately desire happiness, who would you be without the depression?

I'm just stuck, and I'm disappointed with my lack of accomplishments",https://counselchat.com/questions/how-can-i-find-myself-again,depression,"If you are a people-pleaser type or a natural caretaker, you can slowly ""lose yourself"" over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself. If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot. Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to ""take care of everything"" because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly. Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own. You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well; if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don't create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you. If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, it's easy to re-create this in adult relationships.In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this ""self sacrifice at the expense of others"" is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretaker/enabler/people-pleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self. Basically, you spend so much time helping other people that you don't make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment. Before you realize it, you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are. Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable, but if you are always that person that rescues, those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them. In conclusion, learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life. It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now. Take one small step at at a time. Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy, and limit your contact and/or set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soul-searching. Meanwhile, engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with, get yourself outside in the fresh air, get some good sleep, and eat some nourishing food",Ashlie BrownCounselor & Hypnotherapist

I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression. The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey","Tanairy Fernandez, LMHCBalancing your life one step at a time."
57,Is there anything I can do about my depression and anxiety,"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help",https://counselchat.com/questions/is-there-anything-i-can-do-about-my-depression-and-anxiety,depression,"Certainly counselling can help. however, there is a caveat, namely, you will need the right counsellor with the right approach. This leads to two questions: 1) What are the identifiers for the right counsellor, and 2) What is the right approach?1) What are the identifiers for the right counsellor? The right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience. He or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist. This person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges, not as a diagnostic category. He or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work. Further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall. The in-depth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you, the moment, your overall life experience, and their in-the-moment experience. It goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you, value you as a human being, and value the connection. As well, it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist 'gets you.' 2) What is the right approach? As Carl Jung stated, ""When the doctor sits down with the patient he (or she) must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person."" The approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development, attention to pre-verbal imprinting, development of awareness ability, ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience, development of a process orientation, attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met, identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest, increased ability to access and contain non-ordinary states of consciousness, attending to what is, and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development.depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down. anxiety is a signal that something is wrong. anxiety is not the problem. it is a sign that there is a problem. the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding. the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and re-initiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage",Dr. Avraham CohenDepth work with individuals and relationships
58,Does my friend have depression,I am really worried about one of my friends because I think he has major depression. He disagrees with me on that. He is shut off when it comes to talking to people and telling them how he really feels. He told me he feels empty inside and the only emotions he feels are anger and sadness. I suggested to him to get help and talk to his mom about it but he refuses,https://counselchat.com/questions/does-my-friend-have-depression,depression,"First of all, I can tell that you really care about your friend and I think it's great that you are reaching out with your concern. It's hard to determine whether your friend would meet the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression without working with him, however, whether he does or not, therapy may be beneficial for him in working through these difficult feelings and relational challenges. Unfortunately, you can't make your friend get help. He will ultimately need to make that decision for himself, however, you can talk to him about your concerns and your hopes that he will reach out for help",Ben BraaksmaMental Health Counselor
